# LangGraph Learn

A curated exploration of **[LangGraph](https://www.langgraph.dev/)** — a framework for building **stateful, multi-agent applications** using graph-based logic. This repository is designed for practical learning, debugging, and implementing advanced LangGraph patterns including:

- 🔁 Stateful workflows  
- 🧠 Memory management  
- 💬 Human-in-the-loop systems  
- 📍 Checkpointing  
- 🔍 Traceability  
- ⚠️ Agent reliability diagnostics

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- ✅ Integrates **LangChain agents** into LangGraph DAGs
- ✅ Demonstrates **reducers**, **checkpointers**, and **traceable nodes**
- ✅ Explores different types of **memory mechanisms** (e.g., `ConversationBufferMemory`)
- ✅ Introduces **HITL decision nodes**
- ✅ Actively addresses **reliability concerns with LangChain agents** in graphs
